#Lockboxes
We start with the first box open.
We look at all the keys in the open boxes.
For each key:
If it opens a new box, we open that box.
We add any new keys from newly opened boxes to our collection.
We repeat step 3 until we can't open any more boxes.
At the end, we check if we opened all the boxes.
